                        <h3>Voice-Operated Chess Board</h3>
                        <p> It is a hardware based solution with a fascinating chessboard that gives a magical feel. It
                            is a
                            robotic hand operated chess board with an arduino and Raspberry PI used to control the
                            movements
                            and
                            a camera attached to see the current position of different pieces placed on the board. A
                            camera
                            device is used for analyzing the chessboard and for justification of each move. Vocal
                            commands
                            are
                            given for the piece movement and validity of that move is checked. Then, the movement of
                            that
                            particular piece is done by the robotic hand where the hand picks up the piece from the
                            source
                            and
                            places it on the destination.

                        <p>This project is a School Management System website developed for a university course. It
                            utilizes
                            HTML, PHP, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and functional web application. The
                            website
                            features user login capabilities for students, employees, and administrators. It includes
                            functionalities such as quizzes for student assessments and management options for
                            administrators to
                            delete, insert, and update records for both students and employees.</p>

                        <p>The Stopwatch application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery, featuring
                            a
                            user-friendly interface that allows users to track elapsed time. It includes key
                            functionalities
                            such as a Start button to begin the timer, updating the display every second; a Stop button
                            to
                            pause
                            the timer for later resumption; and a Reset button to clear the timer and reset it to zero.
                            The
                            application employs Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various
                            devices,
                            and features a vibrant orange background with clear text and buttons for an enhanced user
